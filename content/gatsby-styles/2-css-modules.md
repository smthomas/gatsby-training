> A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation
names are scoped locally by default.

By using CSS Modules you can have more specific control over your components. If
you have ever found yourself using really long classnames (or `BEM` syntax), you
have an idea of why this might be useful.

I have not personally used CSS Modules much besides going through the Gatsby
examples. If this approach interests you, I encourage you to check out the
[CSS Modules Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#css-modules)
and the [CSS Modules Github Page](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
